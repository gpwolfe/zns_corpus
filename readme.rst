This project is intended as a practice exercise in web scraping and natural
language processing, with the end goal of creating a useful corpus from
the content of he website of ZNS Bahamas. 

zns_bahamas_corpus.py is solely for my use, testing and learning.

make_site_text_to_df.py is being used to create a consistent web scraping 
object.
